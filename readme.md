# Outfitless üëïüëóüëñüëö

[Outfitless](https://www.outfitless.com) helps users organize their closet, choose outfits, and keep track of their clothes. Most notably, it keeps track of the cost per use for each piece of clothing.

Inspired by the trend towards zero waste, capsule wardrobes, and Mari Kondo of ‚ÄúThe Life-Changing Magic of Tidying Up‚Äù, Outfitless hopes that its users will learn to do more with less.

## <a name="about"></a>About the Developer üë©üèª‚Äçüíª
This was created by Janet Anne Panen for her final project at [Hackbright Academy](https://www.hackbrightacademy.com), an engineering school for women.

She's located in San Francisco, and you can contact her via [Twitter](https://www.twitter.com/janetanne), [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/janetanne), or email üìß janetpanen at gmail dot com.

This project was inspired by the annoyance of choosing what to wear every day, and the 90s classic film, *Clueless* (hence the name Outfitless üòâ).
