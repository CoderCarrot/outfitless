    <h1>About the App</h1>
        <p class="text-left">Outfitless helps users organize their closet, choose outfits, and keep track of their clothes. Most notably, it keeps track of the cost per use for each piece of clothing.</p>
        <p class="text-left">Inspired by the trend towards zero waste, capsule wardrobes, and Mari Kondo of "The Life-Changing Magic of Tidying Up", Outfitless hopes that its users will learn to do more with less.</p>
    <h3>Features to come:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>• Data visualization of user's closets</li>
            <li>• Reminders to wear, donate, or sell clothes not worn in a certain period of time</li>
            <li>• Upload photos to Google Photos</li>
        </ul>
    <h4>Created by</h4>
        <p class="text-left">This was created by Janet Anne Panen for her final project at Hackbright Academy, an engineering school for women. And yes—in case you were wondering–she was inspired by Clueless.</p>
